	<h1>TERMS OF USE FOR 15 SECONDS OF FAME, INC.</h1>
	<h2>LAST UPDATED ON JANUARY 29, 2019</h2>
	<p>15 Seconds of Fame, Inc. (“15SOF ”, “we”, “our”, “us”) welcomes you as a viewer, reader, or user of our 15 SECONDS OF FAME™ mobile application, website (located at www.15sof.com and/or www.15SecondsofFame.com) and/or other online services (all the foregoing, collectively, the “15SOF Services”).  We make the 15SOF Services available to you conditioned upon your acceptance of all of the terms, conditions, policies, and notices stated herein (the “Terms”). </p>

	<p>NOTICE: THESE TERMS INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.  PLEASE READ ALL SUCH AND OTHER TERMS CAREFULLY.</p>

	<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONFIRM YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE 15SOF SERVICES; PROVIDED THAT YOU MUST HAVE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOU AND AGREE TO THEM ON YOUR BEHALF IF YOU ARE NOT OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH 15SOF (AGE 18 IN MOST STATES).  DO NOT ACCESS AND/OR USE THE 15SOF SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS.</p>

	<h4>Our mission</h4>

	<p>At 15SOF, our mission is to connect you with special moments of your life.  We want 15SOF to be fun for everyone.  Although these Terms are a legal contract between us and you, adhering to them is not intended to be onerous.  Do your part in keeping up with these Terms, and we will do ours in keeping you connected to your moments that matter.</p>

	<h4>Our Functionality</h4>

	<p>15SOF is primarily operated through its mobile application branded under the mark 15 SECONDS OF FAME™.  An individual user (subject to applicable age restrictions and/or other eligibility requirements set forth herein) may sign up for the application without charge by entering his or her name, e-mail address, date of birth (and/or any other information which may be requested or required), with upload of a photograph of such individual (i.e., a “selfie”).  15SOF licenses content from various sports, entertainment and/or other events (including without limitation content from live television feeds and/or in-venue displays) and uses facial recognition technology to identify registered users in such footage.  15SOF is designed to forward its users short clips (typically 030 seconds) of content in which the user appears.  Clips may contain advertising material (either by way of watermark, pre-roll footage, post-roll footage and/or otherwise), including advertising material which may be targeted to the user based upon information known about such user.  Clips are designed for sharing by the user through one or more of the user’s own social media platforms.  By your acceptance of these Terms, you are agreeing (without limitation) to permit 15SOF to make any and all uses necessary or reasonably desirable to perform and provide such and other 15SOF Services.</p>

	<p>We reserve the right to record, re-purpose or re-publish User Content on the 15SOF Services, newspapers, broadcast stations or other publishing forums.  By posting User Content, you are granting to 15SOF and its licensees a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive and irrevocable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display any content by you or of you (in whole or in part), including any use of your likeness, voice and other identifying characteristics, and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed, including for commercial reasons.

	<h3>DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT PROCEDURE</h3>

	<p>15SOF investigates notices of copyright infringement and takes appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“<strong>DMCA</strong>”), Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c), as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li type="disc">For purposes of providing written notice under the DMCA, 15SOF has designated an agent with the United States Copyright Office (“<strong>Copyright Agent</strong>”).  All written notification, pursuant to the DMCA, must be submitted to the designated Copyright Agent at the following address: <p>United Corporate Services, Inc.<br>15 Seconds of Fame, Inc.<br>874 Walker Road<br>Suite C<br>Dover, DE 19904<br>(877) 734-8300<br>And Simultaneously By Email: <a href="mailto:copyright@15sof.com">copyright@15sof.com</a></p></li>
		<li type="disc">If you are a copyright owner or agent thereof and believe that third-party submitted content or materials, including photographs and digital images (“<strong>Third-Party Submission</strong>”), available through the 15SOF Services infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit written notification, pursuant to the DMCA, to 15SOF’s Copyright Agent, identified above.   To be effective, the written notification must include:
			<ul>
				<li type="circle">A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
				<li type="circle">Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
				<li type="circle">Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</li>
				<li type="circle">Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
				<li type="circle">A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
				<li type="circle">A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li type="disc">If you believe that your Third-Party Submission, which was removed (or to which access was disabled), is not infringing, or that you have authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent or authority under the law, to publish or use the Third-Party Submission, you may submit a written counter-notice, pursuant to the DMCA, to 15SOF’s Copyright Agent, identified above.  To be effective, the written counter-notice must include:
			<ul>
				<li type="circle">Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
				<li type="circle">Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
				<li type="circle">A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and</li>
				<li type="circle">Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person, or the person’s agent, who provided notification of the alleged copyright infringement.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li type="disc">If a counter-notice is received by 15SOF’s Copyright Agent, 15SOF may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party (or agent thereof) informing that person that 15SOF may replace the removed Third-Party Submission or cease disabling it in ten business days. Unless the copyright owner (or agent thereof) files an action seeking a court order against the provider of the Third-Party Submission, the removed Third-Party Submission may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at 15SOF’s sole discretion.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or identification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider (such as or including 15SOF), who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.  Accordingly, if you are uncertain whether Third-Party Submission infringes your or others’ copyrights, please consult with a copyright attorney prior to making a notice under the DMCA.</p>

	<h3>DISPUTES</h3>

	<p>You agree that, if a dispute arises between you and 15SOF, you will first contact 15SOF customer service to describe the problem and seek a resolution.  You may contact customer service using any of the following means:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Email at:  <a href="mailto:Privacy@15sof.com">Privacy@15sof.com</a></li>
		<li>By Telephone – (855) 815-FAME</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>If that does not resolve the issue, then you and 15SOF agree to the following methods to resolve any dispute or claim between us.  First, you agree that the Terms are governed by the law of the State of New York, without regard to its principles on conflicts of laws, and the federal law of the United States of America.  Second, you agree that you will seek arbitration consistent with the rules before initiating any litigation.  If arbitration cannot resolve the issue, you agree, as also set forth below, to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the mandatory and exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.  You agree that you will not object to such jurisdiction and venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, inconvenient forum or otherwise.  EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS.  15SOF reserves all rights, remedies and defenses available to it, in law or equity, with respect to any matter relating to these Terms.</p>

	<h4>Arbitration</h4>

	<p>Any arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (collectively, “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules and costs are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at <a href="tel:18007787879">1-800-778-7879</a>.  YOU AND 15SOF AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and 15SOF agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  Any claim or controversy as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision’s restriction on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or classwide arbitration shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any State court located in New York County, New York.</p>

	<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.  Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>

	<h4>Class Action Waiver</h4>

	<p>Any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member of a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general legal action. Your access and continued use of the 15SOF Services signifies your express consent to this waiver.</p>

	<h4>Governing Law</h4>

	<p>These Terms and all matters regarding your use of the 15SOF Services shall be governed by, construed in accordance with, and enforced under the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and executed and wholly performed in the State of New York, without regard to choice of law principles. Neither the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act nor the United Nations Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods shall apply and their applicability is expressly excluded.</p>

	<h4>Venue</h4>

	<p>Subject to the terms and conditions above governing arbitration, if you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in New York County, New York.  You also agree that the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to principles governing conflicts of law) and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without giving effect to principles governing conflicts of law).  You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in New York County, New York, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us, the 15SOF Services, or these Terms.</p>

	<h4>Deadline to Pursue Claim</h4>

	<p>To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of the 15SOF Services or these Terms must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).</p>
